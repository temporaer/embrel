|        Embedded Relational Learning       |
=============================================

This program produces SVG graphics describing the relationships between queries
and interpretations in a relational learning setting.



Prerequisites
---------------------------------------------

for the c++ program
- a current c++ compiler (>=4.1)
- boost >= 1.35

for the xml->svg conversion script
- perl >= 5.1
- The Perl modules SVG, Convert::Color, File::Util.


Building
---------------------------------------------

$ tar xzvf erl.tar.gz
$ cd erl
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../src
$ make -j2


Installing
---------------------------------------------

not done yet, just run from build directory.



Running
---------------------------------------------

try: 
$ ./erl --help

$ ./erl {action} [options]

there are two main actions:

- count
  this is a Molfea implementation for SDF files
	count does currently not compile on 64bit systems due to known bugs in boost.

- code
	this is a specific RPROP-based CODE implementation for visualization
	purposes.



Examples  -- code
---------------------------------------------
you need two files: the matrix file and the names file.

matrix file
- contains the description of an interpretation in each line
- a line consists of
  - a name for the interpretation (currently ignored)
	- for every query, a number of co-occurrences (usually 1/0)
	- a class label (should be an int)

names file
- contains a list of names for the queries, one per line.

use this name scheme for the files:
Matrix file:   BASENAME.csv
Names  file:   BASENAME-names.csv

you can then run erl using the following command

$ ./erl code --code.input_file BASENAME   --output-dir=`pwd`

currently, the output-dir parameter is _mandatory_.


good luck!
